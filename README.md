# osl-syntax

### About osl-syntax

A [Vim][1] syntax highlighting file for [OpenShadingLanguage][2] and basic configuration files for a dark grey theme, automagical file detection for OSL.
Why all this you may ask? It does provides immediate visual cues, i.e, reserved keywords that will trigger a OSLC compiler fail, and besides, age forgives no one's eyes.

### Installing

Just copy the .vim syntax file to your ~/.vim/syntax directory, and the .vimrc to your ~.
